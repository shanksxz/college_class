## Retrive Data Method

1. Selection -> whenever i am retrive data from data we have some conditions or we use "where" keyword


```sql
select * from person where personId = 101;
```

2. Projection -> whenever i am retrving data from table without any condition , known as projection

```sql
select * from person
```

> note:- both select and project retrive dataa from only single table, for multiple table we use joints



3. Join whenever we want to retrive data from multiple table then we have to use joins. 

- joins is of two types:- 
  - Ansi format(new format style)  in this format we use ```on``` keyword
    1. inner join
    2. outer join (left,right,full)
    3. cross join
    4. natural join
  - Non Ansi format(old format style) in this format we use ```where``` keyword



> Doing Joints practically
1. Creating student and course table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Course(
    courseid INT,
    coursename VARCHAR(25),
    coursefee VARCHAR(25)
)
```

> for joints we must have one column same(here we have ```courseid``` column same)


```sql
CREATE TABLE Student(
    stdid INT,
    sname VARCHAR(25),
    smail VARCHAR(25),
    courseid INT
)
```

2. Inserting value in both tables
```sql
INSERT INTO student (stdid,sname,smail,courseid) VALUES(106,'A6','A6@gmail.com',4006)
INSERT INTO course (courseid,coursename,coursefee) VALUES(4006,'java',100000)
```

3. Retriving data

```sql
select * from student inner join course on student.courseid=course.courseid
```

> note:- we have to mention course id belongs to which table ( we can't just write courseid=courseid)
